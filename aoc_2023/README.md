# Advent of Code 2023
In late 2023 I learned how to use Rust, so as a challenge and a way to improve I attempted the Advent of Code 2023 using only Rust.
It went quite well, up until the final few days. I knew how I could complete them, but I found myself taking a while to come up with efficient solutions, and it would take a while to implement those solutions. I decided that my time was better spent elsewhere, so I stopped at day 21.

Below are my personal times up to day 21. Note that I wasn't able to start on the problem immediately every day, and I experienced some troubles with Rust (as it was still new to me).
