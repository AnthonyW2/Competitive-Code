# Competitive Code Solutions
This is a repository containing my solutions to various competitive coding events, such as the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Background
I don't do a lot of truly competitive coding. Usually I'll solve problems to learn new things or improve my skills.

I first tried the Advent of Code in 2020, using JavaScript, and enjoyed it enough that I came back to do it again.
In late 2023 I learned how to use Rust, so as a challenge and a way to improve I attempted the Advent of Code 2023 using only Rust.

## Other Platforms
I sometimes use Codewars to help learn a new language or practise solving problems:
